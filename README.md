## Introduction 
Abstract Factory pattern is a powerful design pattern that allows us to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Problem Statement
Let's consider a problem that many developers face: How do we create UI components that can easily change their appearance based on the user's theme preference? We need buttons and text fields that can switch between light, dark, and other themes without changing our application's core logic.

## Pattern Overview
The Abstract Factory pattern solves this by providing an interface for creating families of related objects. In our example, we have:

* Abstract interfaces for our UI components
* Concrete implementations for each theme
* Factory interfaces and implementations that create these components
* Client code that works with these components without knowing their concrete types

## Conclusion
To summarize, the Abstract Factory pattern is ideal when you need to create families of related objects and want to ensure they work together seamlessly. It allows your system to be extensible while keeping your client code clean and decoupled from implementations."
